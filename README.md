<p>A survival-crafting game in which the player is stranded within a dome at the bottom of the sea. They must venture outside the dome and salvage materials and catch fish for food. Materials gathered can be used to extend the oxygen tank, build houses within the bubble or even expand the radius of the dome. As upgrades are acquired, they are capable of venturing even further and discovering more of the world. I created the initial concept, player character and developed the user interface. Created as part of Global Game Jam 2025 in collaboration with 3 other students. Engine Used: Unreal Engine 5</p>

<h2> Tomb of Dread</h2>
